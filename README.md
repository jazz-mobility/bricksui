# Bricks — a Design System for SwiftUI

Bricks is an open source Design System  built for SwiftUI, based on [Eva Design System](http://eva.design/), [kittenTricks](https://github.com/akveo/kittenTricks) and, of course, [SwiftUI native components](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/).

## Disclaimer

Although the project is ready to use, it's a work in progress. We’re still implementing lot of new things and we’ll update documentation on a regular basis to better explain every part of it. Please, check it out again after few days.

## Documentation

Find out Bricks full documentation on [Medium](https://medium.com/@fabbiostaiano/25e9d2879eed)

### Getting started

Bricks provides you a fully fledged starter project to easily start building your next app on this framework.
You could download this repo and open it in Xcode, or clone it, or even better open a new terminal window on your Mac and paste this single line of code:

`git clone https://gitlab.com/fabio.staiano/bricksui.git`

In your new Xcode project, you'll find two main folders, one called **BricksUI** that contains all the frameworks setups files and components, and the other one called **YourProject**, that basically is your app folder. Rename this as you wish (as well for the xcodeproj file) and you're ready to recall every premade element we built for you.
