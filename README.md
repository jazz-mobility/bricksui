# Bricks — a Design System for SwiftUI

Bricks is an open source Design System  built for SwiftUI, based on [Eva Design System](http://eva.design/), [kittenTricks](https://github.com/akveo/kittenTricks) and, of course, [SwiftUI native components](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/).

## Disclaimer

Although the project is ready to use it's a work in progress. We’re still implementing lot of new things and we’ll update documentation on a regular basis to better explain every part of it. Please, check it out again after few days.
