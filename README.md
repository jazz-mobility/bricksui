# Bricks — a Design System for SwiftUI

Bricks is an open source Design System  built for SwiftUI, based on [Eva Design System](http://eva.design/), [kittenTricks](https://github.com/akveo/kittenTricks) and, of course, [SwiftUI native components](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/).

## Disclaimer

Although the project is ready to use it's a work in progress. We’re still implementing lot of new things and we’ll update documentation on a regular basis to better explain every part of it. Please, check it out again after few days.

## Documentation

### Getting started

To start a new App with Bricks components just download the project and open it in xcode. In the BricksUI folder you can find the the prebuild elements. Each file contains a preview showing you how to use the specific component. Most of the components are views you can create intances of using diferent initializers depending on your needs. You can start your project in the "YourProject" folder that you can rename fitting to your needs. The same you can do with the xcodeproj file.
